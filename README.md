ðŸš€ Building a Music Player in C++ ðŸŽµ
Iâ€™ve been working on a simple yet functional media player using C++. This project involves:
Dynamic Memory Management: Handling song titles with dynamically allocated memory.
Doubly Linked List: Implementing a playlist using a doubly linked list for seamless navigation.
Sound Playback: Integrating sound playback functionality using Windows APIs.

Features include:
=>Playing the current song
=>Moving to the next/previous song
=>Stopping playback
=>Playing a random song
